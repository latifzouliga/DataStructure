How to approach the problem.
1- Identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problems
2- Write the recurrence relation if needed
3- Draw the recursive tree
4- About the tree
  - see the flow of  the function, how they are getting in the stack
  - Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls

5- See how the value are returned,

Variables: there are thee variables in recursion that we need to take into consideration
1- Arguments
2- return type
3- variables in the body of the function
